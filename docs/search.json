    "text": "In my last post, I demonstrated some changes in exercise and physiological metrics over the course of a week, largely dictated by my weekly habits. However, there are some other changes (both voluntary and involuntary) that occur over the course of the year. This brief walk-through shows some of the data longitudinally over the course of my data collection.\n\n\nTo start, I think it’s neat to demonstrate my HRV over time, while noting the time that I stopped taking an SNRI July 2021 (a medication that alters CNS activity). Once I stopped taking this medication, my HRV increased fairly dramatically.\nAs an aside, I didn’t have my data prior to starting this medication, but the data suggest that the medication was blunting my HRV - an interesting occurrence since this medication is used to lower stress. This is relatively inverse of what people associate from HRV, where stress usually lowers HRV.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, even with 1.5 years of data, this means that I can only really compare July-October across years, but the trends each calendar year are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nOf note, I think it’s interesting that Respiratory Rate seems to have a similar trend across these months despite no clear pattern in HRV or HR. Additionally, you can see pretty subtle changes over time, but August 2022 stands out to me, which was when I took a 2.5 week international vacation, so it seems that big trips across time zones can impose a good amount of stress, even though it wasn’t necessarily perceived as “stress”.\nTo look even broader, having it all laid out kind of illustrates the effect that the SNRI had being larger than any seasonality, although there does appear to be a good bit of fluctuation - I just don’t have enough data to know if that is repeatable over a long time. It does stand to reason that there would be a difference between summer and winter, for example, as the weather and its related effects (heat stress, Vitamin D, daylight exposure, etc.) should theoretically affect some of these health variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickly covering sleep, I had little to no expectations because I keep a close eye on my exercise and nocturnal physiology - just not looking closely at my sleep. I don’t really have a reason why I don’t look at it, but the following graph makes me curious to keep an eye on it in the future.\nParticularly, I didn’t notice I had quite such a large swing in sleep duration between winter and summer. I could have guessed that waking up pretty early to work out before it gets hot costed me a little bit, but it appears almost an hour. Additionally, over time, it looks like I have been getting better quality sleep ( better efficiency, less awakenings, & deep sleep duration - even when total sleep decreases seasonally). I don’t know exactly why, but I do feel that my sleep has improved after finishing grad school in early 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we have the exercise data, I think it’s worth bringing this up as well. I know that my habits change a good bit based on the seasons, mostly due to extended daylight hours, warmer weather, and overall motivation. Looking at duration first, it appears that I have the lowest daily exercise duration in the winter months, and the warmer months tend to be higher. I should also note that June is reduced due to a bike crash in June 2022, meaning I had to stop exercising as much for the majority of that month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at my exercise average heart rate doesn’t seem to yield much information, unsurprisingly. Exercise heart rate data is hard to gain insights on without context. For example, if my heart rate goes up in the summer, is it because: I’m less fit for the same workload? I’m equally fit but training harder? I’m equally fit & training the same but I’m training in hotter environments?… The point being that I wouldn’t explicitly expect seasonal trends unless many things were held constant.\n\n\n\n\n\nHOWEVER, I can get at some of that. To fully look into that is beyond the scope of this post, but if we just plot a simple graph using pace per heart rate (this was m/s per beat/s, yielding beats per meter), we can get a very rough index of efficiency. PLEASE NOTE: I do not support this for exercise modeling. It is not a very linear relationship or mathematically sound; this is just to get a point across. Additionally, this is running only, as biking has too many other variables at play with speed.\nWhen doing this, it appears that I’m most “efficient” during March and October, which makes sense to me. March tends to be when I am on a fitness trend upwards from being less in-shape over the winter, the temperature is usually very pleasant, and the humidity hasn’t come in yet; October is when it starts cooling down, the humidity goes away, and I’m usually coming off of racing season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those curious, speed is presented below. The running portion may be more insightful, as I tend to keep my routes and running partner rather consistent. Biking is a much different story, where you can see I vary much more widely, particularly in October where I do a short stint in Cyclocross training/racing, slowing my speed down; it’s important to remember thought that I do a number of disciplines from mountain, gravel, road, TT, etc., so average speed isn’t particularly insightful in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, along with the last post, is really just meant to illustrate the non-stationarity in health and exercise data. In many regards, the seasonality is smaller than expected (i.e. in health and sleep data), but exercise (a habit of sorts) seems obvious we would see some changes based on weather, daylight, etc.\nAnother interesting note was before and after the SNRI. I knew that there was a change at the time in my HRV, but I didn’t realize how much it had potentially affected my sleep. It was not supposed to be a point of this article, but the signal seemed too big to not address. Unfortunately this may have been what caused my inability to look across seasons effectively, but it happens and represents “real-world data”.\nThis and the last post about trends are really just an introduction into the data to help visualize what data exists, but I’ll start exploring relationships and modeling as we go."

    "text": "Health and wellness tracking has increased substantially over the years. I wanted to do a demonstration of some insights that I can gain from my own personal data.\n\n\nWhile wearables are fairly ubiquitous, many individuals are using them speculatively. I often hear from people using devices that track health and sleep something to the effect of: “I notice than that when I do [some habit], I see a big change in [some sleep/health metric].”\nThis is great to hear, as many people are getting inspired to correlate habits with health, but the process could be improved. The most important parts of this are:\n1. Being able to use data to back up these claims and control for other occurrences.\n2. Being able to quantify how much something is impacted and if it is meaningful (both clinically and statistically).\n\n\n\nThere were two main sources of data, dating from April 14, 2021 to January 31, 2023:\n- Physiological: Sleep session only physiological parameters (i.e. sleep average HRV, amount of deep sleep, etc.)\n- Exercise: All of my swims, bike rides, and runs were recorded using one of three GPS-based devices and then aggregated through Strava, Golden Cheetah, and some custom Python scripts to process the activities the way I wanted. It is important to note that all other physical activity was not included, which means things like dog walks (~3/day), errands, standing at my standing desk, etc., which should not be discredited.\nThis is meant to be a representative, feasible approach, which replicates data that would be relatively easy to collect via APIs in a central app. More data could be had, but would require more user-related input and thus, less overall compliance. A short period was used to address some of these short-comings, and more studies will be done to address even more short-comings.\n\n\n\nFor a period of 72 days, I kept a journal, with the goal to see how much information a quick (< 1 min. to complete) questionnaire could add to contextualize more of the data.\nThese questions included questions about:\n- the amount and timing of coffee, alcohol, and sex\n- the nature of snacking before bed\n- feedback about how my workouts felt\n- nutrition quality/quantity and supplements\n- other miscellaneous tags (COVID, illness, injury, travel, conflict, etc.)\n\n\n\nThere will be many posts to follow, but for now, I wanted to set the stage of what the data looks like.\nDaily Exercise Averages over the entire period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Exercise Metric\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    Duration [min]\n108.35\n    Distance [km]\n33.42\n    Average HR [bpm]\n138.38\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nNightly Biostrap Averages over the entire period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Biostrap Variable\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    Sleep Score [A.U.]\n79.84\n    Total Sleep [min]\n440.38\n    Efficiency [%]\n91.81\n     HRV (Sleep Avg.

    "text": "While there are many ways to model the data, the first step can, and should, always be data exploration. In the instance of health behaviors, it’s important to remember something simple, but often forgotten: our behaviors are largely determined by our life. In particular, most people operate on a weekly schedule, typically something resembling 5 days of work and 2 days off of work.\nThus, it makes sense to start exploring the data on a weekly basis.\n\n\nFor example, we can start by characterizing what changes occur over a week, since this is how we often set up training schedules and have our life events scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a demonstration on the percentage of activities performed on each day of the week. This is roughly analagous to the odds that I would do a particular sport on a particular day.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:This does look different during different phases (I was still swimming less during 2021 due to COVID and life), but some patterns still stand out. For example, I almost always do my Tuesday track workout, a Wednesday bike ride, and another run on Thursday (although for awhile I was doing two-a-days with a bike in there as well). Additionally, if I swim, it’s pretty much only Mondays or Fridays.\nFor product builders, AI coaching programmers, or other individuals working with this kind of data, it might be important to keep track of patterns in something like the type of workout completed and encouraging consistency, as many good coaches will attest to the power of consistency in training.\n\n\n\nThis next plot breaks down the distribution of when I typically work out each day.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, there were lots of different factors that changed over the entire window, but it typically looks like I prefer to work out after work on Mon/Tues/Fri, maybe before work on Wed/Thurs (typically in the summer when it’s warmer), and morning on the weekends.\nSome smart watch users might notice that this might be why they get the “You’re usually active by now” or similar. More importantly, as a later blog post will cover, this is a potentially important factor to consider when modeling training and recovery, as proximity before bed may be an important factor on sleep quality.\n\n\n\nThe next plots show duration, average heart rate, max heart rate, and a custom TRIMP score for each day of the week. It should be noted that I typically do a hard track workout on Tuesdays, do a medium-sized ride on Wednesday, and long runs/rides on the weekends, which all should be explained in the graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exercise component pretty simple when laid out in terms of how I schedule my week, but what about biometrics?\nThere is lots to cover, but I’m hightling two variables in the interest of keeping the article short: Sleep HRV and Sleep Session Duration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s interesting to me to see that I generally have the highest sleep average HRV reported on Tuesday (Monday’s night of sleep), which likely follows that Mondays are my easiest workout days. Then there’s a small but noteworthy trend for my sleep average HRV to decrease on the weekends. Friday morning (sleep from Thursday night) seems to be a wild-card, and may be due to the fact that I sometimes did two-a-days and/or pub trivia in the evening, which we can dive into later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough this metric is the simplest of the ones the Biostrap measures, it surprised me the most (which goes to show how easy it can be to miss trends without data analysis). It appears I spend less time in bed as the week goes on, and then, more predictably, the weekends (Friday and Saturday nights) tend to have more variable sleep.\nI suspect that this trend is brought about by getting busier throughout the week, as I’m likely trying to finish projects before the weekend, staying up a bit later each night, Then on the weekends it depends on whether I made plans the night before and/or want to sleep in a bit. The two graphs below somewhat demonstrate that indeed I tend to shift to a later sleep time as the work week goes on, and somewhat try to sleep in to make it up, but not enough. I didn’t even realize I was doing this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point of this section is not to do an exhaustive review of my biometrics, but rather to highlight the trends that occur through the week in my habits and connect them to physiological outcomes.\nFor those in the space of physiological monitoring, it is likely way more beneficial to figure out how to collect data alongside the wearables component and contextualize the “why” of the matter.\n\n\n\nWhile this is just scratching the surface of the data I have, I do think it’s important to contextualize this for many scenarios. For example: modeling human behavior and physiological outcomes might make more sense when accounting for someone’s routine and behaviors; alternatively, tracking routine might enable better AI coaching and catch deviations in behavior or make better recommendations.\nWith this covered, I can move on to some cooler relationships in the data, causal inference, and hopefully a bit of timeseries model discussions. Please send me any questions you have about this data!"
