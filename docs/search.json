    "text": "Health and wellness tracking has increased substantially over the years. I wanted to do a demonstration of some insights that I can gain from my own personal data.\n\n\nWhile wearables are fairly ubiquitous, many individuals are using them speculatively. I often hear from people using devices that track health and sleep something to the effect of: “I notice than that when I do [some habit], I see a big change in [some sleep/health metric].”\nThis is great to hear, as many people are getting inspired to correlate habits with health, but the process could be improved. The most important parts of this are:\n1. Being able to use data to back up these claims and control for other occurrences.\n2. Being able to quantify how much something is impacted and if it is meaningful (both clinically and statistically).\n\n\n\nThere were two main sources of data, dating from April 14, 2021 to January 31, 2023:\n- Physiological: Sleep session only physiological parameters (i.e. sleep average HRV, amount of deep sleep, etc.)\n- Exercise: All of my swims, bike rides, and runs were recorded using one of three GPS-based devices and then aggregated through Strava, Golden Cheetah, and some custom Python scripts to process the activities the way I wanted. It is important to note that all other physical activity was not included, which means things like dog walks (~3/day), errands, standing at my standing desk, etc., which should not be discredited.\nThis is meant to be a representative, feasible approach, which replicates data that would be relatively easy to collect via APIs in a central app. More data could be had, but would require more user-related input and thus, less overall compliance. A short period was used to address some of these short-comings, and more studies will be done to address even more short-comings.\n\n\n\nFor a period of 72 days, I kept a journal, with the goal to see how much information a quick (< 1 min. to complete) questionnaire could add to contextualize more of the data.\nThese questions included questions about:\n- the amount and timing of coffee, alcohol, and sex\n- the nature of snacking before bed\n- feedback about how my workouts felt\n- nutrition quality/quantity and supplements\n- other miscellaneous tags (COVID, illness, injury, travel, conflict, etc.)\n\n\n\nThere will be many posts to follow, but for now, I wanted to set the stage of what the data looks like.\nDaily Exercise Averages over the entire period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Exercise Metric\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    Duration [min]\n108.35\n    Distance [km]\n33.42\n    Average HR [bpm]\n138.38\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nNightly Biostrap Averages over the entire period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Biostrap Variable\n      Value\n    \n  \n  \n    Sleep Score [A.U.]\n79.84\n    Total Sleep [min]\n440.38\n    Efficiency [%]\n91.81\n     HRV (Sleep Avg. [ms])\n90.95\n    HR (Sleep Avg. [bpm])\n50.21\n    Lf/Hf (Sleep Avg. [A.U.])\n1.12\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nLongitudinal Data"

    "text": "While there are many ways to model the data, the first step can, and should, always be data exploration. In the instance of health behaviors, it’s important to remember something simple, but often forgotten: our behaviors are largely determined by our life. In particular, most people operate on a weekly schedule, typically something resembling 5 days of work and 2 days off of work.\nThus, it makes sense to start exploring the data on a weekly basis.\n\n\nFor example, we can start by characterizing what changes occur over a week, since this is how we often set up training schedules and have our life events scheduled.\nBelow is a demonstration on the percentage of activities performed on each day of the week. This is roughly analagous to the odds that I would do a particular sport on a particular day.\nNote:This does look different during different phases (I was still swimming less during 2021 due to COVID and life), but some patterns still stand out. For example, I almost always do my Tuesday track workout, a Wednesday bike ride, and another run on Thursday (although for awhile I was doing two-a-days with a bike in there as well). Additionally, if I swim, it’s pretty much only Mondays or Wednesdays.\nFor product builders, AI coaching programmers, or other individuals working with this kind of data, it might be important to keep track of patterns in something like the type of workout completed and encouraging consistency, as many good coaches will attest to the power of consistency in training.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next plot breaks down the distribution of when I typically work out each day. Again, there were lots of different factors that changed over the entire window, but it typically looks like I prefer to work out after work on Mon/Tues/Fri, maybe before work on Wed/Thurs (typically in the summer when it’s warmer), and morning on the weekends.\nSome smart watch users might notice that this might be why they get the “You’re usually active by now” or similar. More importantly, as a later blog post will cover, this is a potentially important factor to consider when modeling training and recovery, as proximity before bed may be an important factor on sleep quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next plots show duration, average heart rate, max heart rate, and a custom TRIMP score for each day of the week. It should be noted that I typically do a hard track workout on Tuesdays, do a medium-sized ride on Wednesday, and long runs/rides on the weekends, which all should be explained in the graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is just scratching the surface of the data I have, I do think it’s important to contextualize this for many scenarios. For example: modeling human behavior and physiological outcomes might make more sense when accounting for someone’s routine and behaviors; alternatively, tracking routine might enable better AI coaching and catch deviations in behavior or make better recommendations.\nWith this covered, I can move on to some cooler relationships in the data, causal inference, and hopefully a bit of timeseries model discussions. Please send me any questions you have about this data!"
